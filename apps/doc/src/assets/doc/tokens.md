These are the design tokens of the UI library, which correspond to design choices such as color and typography, and which are defined via CSS variables or styled using the native HTML tags. They are the base upon which all the rest is built.

There are more tokens defined in the [CSS library](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks/tree/main/packages/ui/src/lib/styles)
