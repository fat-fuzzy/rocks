## External Cycles

As a tech practitioner, I can be certain of one thing, and that's

<div class="ff:callout bg:warning:200 maki:block ravioli:xs text:center font:lg shape:mellow">change</div>

Over the years, I have seen industry focus go back and forth between languages, tools, libraries, frameworks, architectures.... the list goes on. I have had preferences within that flux and have learned to adapt to the collective choices of the teams I work with. At times, navigating these cycles has been

Ultimately though, managing change is a big chunk of what my job entails.

This blog (and this site) is a reflection of my [evolving posture](/about/decisions) within those cycles ♻️

## The Web

As creative person, I like to explore, make choices, express ideas, and learn from (mine and others') experiences and mistakes. The [open web](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform) empowers me to do many of these things.

This blog is my way of expressing that 🩷

## Creative Agency

I try to exercise my [agency](https://www.recurse.com/self-directives) in creative ways, and no, I am not of the artificial autonomous kind.

Expect tech notes and some write-ups, expect opinions and drawings, expect experiments... but above all
