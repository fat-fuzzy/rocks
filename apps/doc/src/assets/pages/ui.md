Fat Fuzzy UI is a design guide and component library and that aims to maximize use HTML and
CSS's native capabilities to produce harmonious and robust designs.

The underlying intention of all this is that interfaces may adapt to all sorts of browser environments and display conditions so that users can happily access the content and functionality of the app (a website being a specific kind of app).

The structure of the library as well as the way the components are designed draws heavily from the following sources:

- The blog post [Algorithmic Design](https://every-layout.dev/blog/algorithmic-design/) and the lessons and examples in [every-layout](https://every-layout.dev/)
- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/)
- [Open Props](https://open-props.style/)
- [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design)

While this library and the rest of the work on this website were conceived as a research project and is not specifically intended for distribution, if you are curious as to how it's built, the code is available here:

- [@fat-fuzzy/ui](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks/tree/main/packages/ui): the component library, built in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - I migrated it recently to [Svelte 5](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/introduction), and I am very happy with the transition!
- [@fat-fuzzy/style](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks/tree/main/packages/style): the CSS library
- [@fat-fuzzy/playbook](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks/tree/main/packages/playbook): the library that underlies the component demos

The library as well as its documentation are still a work in progress and under active
development. Thank you for your patience! ❤️</p>
