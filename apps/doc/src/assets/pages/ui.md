## Introduction

Fat Fuzzy UI is a design guide and component library and that aims to maximize use HTML and
CSS's native capabilities to produce harmonious and robust designs.

The structure of the library as well as the way the components are designed draws heavily from the following sources:

- The blogpost [Algorithmic Design](https://every-layout.dev/blog/algorithmic-design/)
- The lessons and examples in [every-layout](https://every-layout.dev/)
- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/)
- [Open Props](https://open-props.style/)
- [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design)

While this library and the rest of the work on this website is not built with the objective to be used as a dependency in external projects, it you are curious as to how this is built, you can see the code here:

- [@fat-fuzzy/ui](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks/tree/main/packages/ui): the component library, built in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - I migrated it recently to [Svelte 5](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/introduction), and I am very happy with the transition!
- [@fat-fuzzy/style](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks/tree/main/packages/style): the CSS library
- [@fat-fuzzy/playbook](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks/tree/main/packages/playbook): the library that underlies the component demos

The library as well as its documentation are still a work in progress and under active
development. Thank you for your patience! ❤️</p>
