Fat Fuzzy UI is a design guide and component library and that aims to maximize use HTML and
CSS's native capabilities to produce harmonious and robust designs.

The underlying intention of all this is to build interfaces that can adapt to all sorts of browser environments and display conditions so that users may happily access the content and functionality of the app (a website being a specific kind of app).

The structure of the library as well as the way the components are designed draws heavily from the following sources:

- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/)
- [every-layout](https://every-layout.dev/)
- [Open Props](https://open-props.style/)
- [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design)

This library and the rest of the work on this website were conceived as a research project and are not specifically intended for distribution, but if you are curious as to how it's built, the code is available under an MIT license here:
