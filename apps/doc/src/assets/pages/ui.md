Fat Fuzzy UI is a design guide and component library and that aims to maximize use HTML and
CSS's native capabilities to produce harmonious and robust designs.

The underlying intention of all this is that interfaces may adapt to all sorts of browser environments and display conditions so that users can happily access the content and functionality of the app (a website being a specific kind of app).

The structure of the library as well as the way the components are designed draws heavily from the following sources:

- The blog post [Algorithmic Design](https://every-layout.dev/blog/algorithmic-design/) and the lessons and examples in [every-layout](https://every-layout.dev/)
- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/)
- [Open Props](https://open-props.style/)
- [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design)

This library and the rest of the work on this website were conceived as a research project and are not specifically intended for distribution, but if you are curious as to how it's built, the code is available under an MIT license here:

- [@fat-fuzzy/ui](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks/tree/main/packages/ui): a component library, built in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), recently migrated to [Svelte 5](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/introduction). I am very happy with the transition!
- [@fat-fuzzy/style](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks/tree/main/packages/style): a CSS library
- [@fat-fuzzy/playbook](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks/tree/main/packages/playbook): the library that underlies the component demos

The library as well as its documentation are still a work in progress and under active
development. Thank you for your patience! ❤️</p>
