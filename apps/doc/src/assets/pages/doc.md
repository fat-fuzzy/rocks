## What is Fat Fuzzy ?

Fat Fuzzy Rocks is a collection of packages I began working on in order to scratch my own itch :
I wanted an app that would allow me to display and interact with canvas animations as I began learning WebGL.

In parallel, I had become somewhat tired of shuffling gists around research and learning projects, using a bit of CSS mixin here, a quickly whipped up HTML there and a dash of JavaScript elsewhere.

So I decided to gather my thoughts and put my efforts in a codebase that I could improve over time.
Along came my batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), at which point I channelled my volitional muscles to work on the thing.

This website is the result of that work. It's also its documentation, and the support for learning I was aiming for!

In terms of stack, it is very much front end work. It is is essentially a JAMStack site without the "A". It's built with HTML, CSS, Svelte, and I add the WebGL lessons I complete as I continue to learn. I might add a backend at some point.

The code is [accessible on GitHub](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks), and the illustrations and design are my own.
