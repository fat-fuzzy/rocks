## What is Fat Fuzzy ?

Fat Fuzzy Rocks is a collection of packages I developed to scratch my own itch :
I wanted an app that would allow me to display and interact with canvas animations as I began learning WebGL.

Up until then, I had been shuffling gists around for my research and experiments, most of which required some sort of interface. I had become tired of using a bit of CSS mixin here, a quickly whipped up HTML there and a dash of JavaScript elsewhere to solve this recurring problem.

So I decided to gather my thoughts and put my efforts in a codebase that I could improve over time.
Along came my batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), at which point I channelled my volitional muscles to do the thing.

This website is the result of that work!

The code is [accessible on GitHub](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks), and the illustrations and design are my own.
