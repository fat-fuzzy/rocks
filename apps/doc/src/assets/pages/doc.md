## Context

I began this project because I wanted an app that would allow me to display and interact with WebGL animations during my learning journey.

## Contents

Below is a rough attempt at categorizing the contents of this project.

- **Tools** Tools aim to provide solutions to quickly bootstrap new (web) applications.
- **Playgrounds** Playgrounds are projects used learn, play, and experiment.
- **Doc** Self explanatory, these are projects that document what I learn and the tools I make so I can understand what I was doing back then, how it may be useful now, and things that need improvement.
