Here you'll find my creative coding sketches.
They may be personal explorations, pieces of larger works in progress, or simple experiments with code.

I enjoy exploring the creative possibilities of code and learning from the experience, so unless specifically stated, these are all "handmade".

The code may be more or less polished. Tags may be technical or theme-based.
