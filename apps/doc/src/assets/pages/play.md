The animations on this page are exercises from [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org) and [WebGL2 Fundamentals](https://webgl2fundamentals.org).

As I began learning WebGL, I wished to have a way to easily setup the interfaces that I need to display graphics programs and interact with the canvas. This is the result.

I shall update this page with my own experiments and ideas once I've grown a bit more comfortable with what I am doing !
