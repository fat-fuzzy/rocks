As I began learning WebGL, I wished to have a way to easily setup the interfaces that I need to display graphics programs and interact with the canvas.

After [some](https://github.com/patiboh/fuzzy-playground) [rounds](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/playground) of [iteration](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks/tree/main/packages/ui-s4/src/lib/components/graphics), I managed to build a small library that I enjoyed working with: [@fat-fuzzy/sketch](https://github.com/fat-fuzzy/rocks/tree/main/packages/sketch). Working on this taught me many things about the interplay between canvas events and user generated ones, as well as the lifecycle of WebGL code - all of which I'm still learning!

I hope to share more about these topics soon üê∞

The canvas animations are exercises from [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org) and [WebGL2 Fundamentals](https://webgl2fundamentals.org).

I shall update this page with experiments and ideas as I make progress.
