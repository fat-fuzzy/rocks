As I began learning WebGL, I wished to have a way to easily setup the interfaces that I need to display graphics programs and interact with the canvas. The interface is built using Svelte, and the canvas animations are exercises from [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org) and [WebGL2 Fundamentals](https://webgl2fundamentals.org).

I shall update this page with experiments and ideas as I progress.
