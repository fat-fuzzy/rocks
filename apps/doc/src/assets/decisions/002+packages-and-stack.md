## Context and Problem

Define initial package structure in Monorepo.
Meet the following requirements:

- **Integrates an automated design workflow**
  design changes can be implemented easily and gracefully
- **Is flexible**
  I can create a variety of common application scenarios using the existing packages
- **Is efficiently documented**
  It is easy to understand how the packages work together
- **Is well tested and easily testable**
  I can make changes with confidence
- **Has a low maintenance cost**
  I want to minimize dependencies, try to keep the repo as focused as possible (this deserves more thought)

## Considered Options

Resulting architecture is based on:

- Open-source examples (Svelte, serverless framework, JAM Stack, arc42, ...)
- Experience from personal projects (GraphQL, Svelte, AWS, serverless framework, testing, UI Design)
- Current client work (Node, GraphQL, Vue, testing)
- Experience from previous client work (WordPress, React, JSON Schemas, AWS, Design Systems)

**TODO** : Add links

## Decision

Initial package structure:

- **api** API code
- **client** frontend application structure
- **components** frontend component library
- **design** design tokens and other relevant design resources
- **doc** architectural decisions and other doc-worthy information
- **resources** backend resources (database, auth, storage, etc)
- **utils** common utilities
