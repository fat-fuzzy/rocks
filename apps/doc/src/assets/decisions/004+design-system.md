## Context and Problem

I need to have a source of truth for design decisions, and a way to ensure a better and consistent quality of frontend components and UI in general. I also want to make sure that any improvements I make are reflected across the sites that use these components.
Design systems are made for this.

## Considered Options

- Do not do a design system and work in priority on other aspects (graphics library, indiewebsite)
- Do a design system and work on other subjects in parallel

## Decision

I think I can push for the stretch and try to implement a (tiny) design system.
I will build the gl lib and the indiewebsite in parallel.
The design system will make my job easier in the long run: the project is small enough to get a solid start now.

Given the scale of this project I'll borrow from this source to get me started:
