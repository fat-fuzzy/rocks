## Introduction

Fat Fuzzy UI is a design guide and component library and that aims to maximize use HTML and
CSS's native capabilities to produce harmonious and robust designs.

The components are built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), and the structure of the library as well as the way the components are designed are based on the
ideas put forth in [Algorithmic Design](https://every-layout.dev/blog/algorithmic-design/) and [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/).
