## Usage

`CSSTgv` takes its name from _Train Ã  Grande Vitesse_, the french fast train railway system.
This is a generous and robust responsive layout that traverses the full page content in one fast scroll.
With its minimal-chic aesthetic this layout is great for showcasing high impact content.

Be sure to optimize your visuals and polish your storytelling for this one: a slot in one of its framed sections is sure to grab attention, but its wide-section format can run up a bill on performance metrics if you're not careful.
