## Usage

`CSSMetro` is the versatile and trusty layout that gets your pages from start to end with the rhythm and pauses you'd expect from your daily webpage.

Don't be fooled by its unassuming appearance: used right, this layout will bring out the full flavour of your content's mixed ingredients. Whether you favour prose, forms, visuals or other media, the `CSSMetro` layout has your back.

Before you know it, your markup will be rising early with the a11y makers and flying home with the CSS owls.
