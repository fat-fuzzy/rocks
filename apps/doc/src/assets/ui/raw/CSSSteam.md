## Usage

If you are watching from the sidelines as the ai-creative-blob takes over the universe while thinking: "... but I _want_ to learn how to do the thing!" then the `CSSSteam` layout is the thing for you!

Hop aboard the `CSSSteam` for a split view horizon where an interactive media element can travel next to accessible controls on very small viewports - in both portrait and landscape - up to large desktop screens.
The `CSSSteam` layout will show you HTML and CSS vistas that will let your channel your JS efforts where they are really needed, if they are needed all.
