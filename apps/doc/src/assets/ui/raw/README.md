## What is Raw ?

`Raw` components are [HTML/CSS]-only templates, the raw ingredients of a web page if you accept the analogy.
These templates are not meant to be used as drop-in components: they are testing grounds and guides.

- `CSS Theme` is a simple test sheet for CSS theme values
- `rails` templates are grid templates named using railway transport analogies (`CSSRailway`, `CSSTgv`, etc). These are helpful to think about layout in terms of information architecture of full page views or page sections.
