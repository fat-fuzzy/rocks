- **@fat-fuzzy/sketch** a library used to display and handle interactive web graphics program: this usage is one of the initial motivations for this project

## Usage Examples

The packages in this repo can be used together or independently, depending on the use case.
For example, the package **ui** can be used to build apps in different contexts:

- on a Django app and in a Jupyter Notebook (currently in a private repo)
- this website is built using the following packages:
  - **@fat-fuzzy/style**
  - **@fat-fuzzy/ui**
  - **@fat-fuzzy/playbook** used to render the content and functionality of the [UI](/ui) page and its children
  - **@fat-fuzzy/sketch** used to render the children of the [PLAY](/play) page
- The package **lib/gfx** package is a package that I use to learn web graphics.
- I'm experimenting with data analysis and learning R: I built the **@fat-fuzzy/git-poule** script to analyze the work done in this repo
