## Usage Examples

The packages in this repo can be used together or independently, depending on the use case.

For example, the package `@fat-fuzzy/ui` can be used to build apps in different contexts:

- on a Django app and in a Jupyter Notebook (currently in a private repo)
- this website is built using the following packages:
  - `@fat-fuzzy/style`
  - `@fat-fuzzy/ui`
  - `@fat-fuzzy/playbook` used to render the content and functionality of the [UI](/ui) page and its children
  - `@fat-fuzzy/sketch` used to render the children of the [PLAY](/play) page
- I use the `gfx` library in the package `@fat-fuzzy/lib` to gather what I learn about web graphics
- I'm experimenting with data analysis and learning R: I built the `@fat-fuzzy/git-poule` script to analyze the work done in this repo
