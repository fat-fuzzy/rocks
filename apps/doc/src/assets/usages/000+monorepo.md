## Architecture

The initial motivation for this monorepo setup was usage of [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [Turborepo's workspaces conventions](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/existing-monorepo#configure-workspaces).

It evolves when necessary.

### Stack

The main technologies I use to build this project are HTML, CSS, Svelte (with TypeScript), and Markdown.
I also add the WebGL shaders I write as I continue to learn, and might add a backend at some point.

### Packages Overview

The repository is organized into three workspaces:

- **apps** : contains client facing code, organized by project
  - **doc** : This site!
- **infra** : contains infrastructure code
  - This is WIP and in private repos for the moment
- **packages** : contains UI, web graphics, logic and experiments libraries, as well as common config

You can learn more about individual packages in the [Packages](/doc/usage/packages) section.

## Requirements

- To publish a package to the private registry, run the following command in the package's root directory:

  ```shell
