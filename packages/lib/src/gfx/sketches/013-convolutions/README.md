## What / Why

Implements the following lessons of the [webgl3fundamentals.org](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/:

- convolution section from the [Tutorial on Textures](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-image-processing.html)
- applying multiple effects from [Tutorial on Textures Continued](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-image-processing-continued.html)

> If you wanted to do full on image processing you'd probably need many GLSL programs. A program for hue, saturation and luminance adjustment. Another for brightness and contrast. One for inverting, another for adjusting levels, etc.
