Fat Fuzzy UI is a component library that aims to maximize use HTML and CSS's native capabilities to produce harmonious and robust designs.

The work in this library is based on the ideas put forth in the following resources:

- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi)
- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev)

The components are built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

🚧 The library as well as its documentation are still a work in progress and under active
development.

Thank you for your patience! ❤️
