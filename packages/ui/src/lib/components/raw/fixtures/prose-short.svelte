	<h3>Artist: Iggy Pop</h3>
	<p>I am the passenger and I ride and I ride</p>
	<p>I ride through the city's backsides</p>
	<p>I see the stars come out of the sky</p>
	<p>Yeah the bright and hollow sky</p>
	<p>You know it looks so good tonight</p>
	<br />
	<p>I am the passenger</p>
	<p>I stay under glass</p>
	<p>I look through my window so bright</p>
	<p>I see the stars come out tonight</p>
	<p>I see the bright and hollow sky</p>
	<p>Over the city's ripped backsides</p>
	<p>And everything looks good tonight</p>
	<p>Get into the car, we'll be the passenger</p>
	<p>We'll ride through the city tonight</p>
	<p>We'll see the city's ripped backside</p>
	<p>We'll see the bright and hollow sky</p>
	<p>We'll see the stars that shine so bright</p>
	<p>Stars made for us tonight</p>
	<p>Oh the passenger</p>
	<p>Oh how he rides</p>
	<p>Oh the passenger</p>
	<p>He rides and he rides</p>
	<p>He looks through his window</p>
	<br />
	<p>What does he see ?</p>
	<p>He sees the bright and hollow sky</p>
	<p>He sees the stars come out tonight</p>
	<p>He sees the city's ripped backsides</p>
	<p>He sees the winding ocean drive</p>
	<p>And everything was made for you and me</p>
	<p>All of it was made for you and me</p>
	<p>Cause it belongs to you and me</p>
	<p>So let's take a ride</p>
	<p>And see what's mine</p>
	<p>Oh the passenger</p>
	<p>He rides and he rides</p>
	<p>He sees things from under glass</p>
	<p>He looks through his window side</p>
	<p>He sees the things he knows are his</p>
	<p>He sees the bright and hollow sky</p>
	<p>He sees the city sleep at night</p>
	<p>He sees the stars are out tonight</p>
	<br />
	<p>And all of it is yours and mine</p>
	<p>And all of it is yours and mine</p>
	<p>So let's ride and ride</p>
