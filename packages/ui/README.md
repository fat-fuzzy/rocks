# Fat Fuzzy UI

Fat Fuzzy UI is a component library that aims to maximize use HTML and CSS's native
capabilities to produce harmonious and robust designs.

The components are built using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [SvelteKit]("https://kit.svelte.dev/), and the structure of the library as well as the way the components are designed are based on the ideas put forth in [Algorithmic Design](https://every-layout.dev/blog/algorithmic-design/) and [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
