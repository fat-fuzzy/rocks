Blocks are components that render the contentful elements of the application. Contentful in this context means elements that provide information, actions, or navigation options to the user of the app.

They are implemented using the [web platform's capabilities](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) and with help from the examples provided in [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/).

Blocks can be [composed](https://cube.fyi/composition.html) with Layouts and other Blocks to create simple or elaborate interfaces while respecting HTML semantics and document structure.
